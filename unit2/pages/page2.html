     <li><h2>Early Stages</h2></li>
      <dt><dd>Stars are born in nebulae, which are full of hydrogen gas. Gravity pulls the hydrogen together, which increases its pull on more hydrogen. Over time so much gas is drawn that they become round and condense into a protostar.</dd></dt>
     <li><h2>The getting there stage</h2></li>
      <dt><dd>Protostars are clouds of gas that aren't hot enough to achieve fusion in their core. As gravity begins to pull these clouds, they become hotter and eventually reach 15 million degrees Fahrenheit and stars fusing the hydrogen into helium. The larger the star the shorter the protostar stage. Big stars may only be a protostar for 1 million years, while medium and small stars can take up to 50 and over 100 million years, respectively.</dd></dt>
      <li><h2>Main Sequence</h2></li>
        <dt><dd>When a star achieves fusion, it becomes stable and starts the main sequence of its life. The energy the star releases stops gravity from condensing the star, if it has hydrogen to fuse in its core. Stars are typically able to keep enough hydrogen in their core for billions of years. When a star reaches the end of its main sequence it will run out of hydrogen in its core and begin to fuse the helium into carbon. This makes the star get hotter, which begins to make the outer layers fuse hydrogen, making the star bigger.</dd></dt>
     <li><h2>Death of a star</h2></li>
        <dt><dd>At the end of its life, a star will die. How the star will die depends on its size. Most stars become white dwarfs, but some will succumb to gravity and explode. If a star is big enough, its core can survive a supernova and become a neutron star or a black hole. Only stars that are at least 3x bigger than the sun, form black holes.</dd></dt>
