      <ul>
        <li><b>Blue Stars</b></li>
          <dt>-Typically hot stars (around 10-50 thousand Kelvin) that live a relatively short life, as they burn through fuel much quicker</dt><br>
        <li><b>Red Dwarf</b></li>
          <dt>-The most common type of star in the universe. They have low mass and are cooler than other stars. They are able to conserve their hydrogen core longer than other stars. Astronomers estimate they can burn up to 10 trillion years.</dt><br>
        <li><b>Yellow Dwarf</b></li>
          <dt>-These stars make up 10% of the stars in the Milky Way. Their surface temperature is around 6000&deg;C. Our Sun is a Yellow Dwarf, but emits white light because all of the colors blend together</dt><br>
        <li><b>Orange Dwarfs</b></li>
          <dt>-These stars emit less UV radiation and are an interest in the search for life in the univere as they can remain stable up to 30 billion years.</dt><br>
        <li><b>Supergaint</b></li>
          <dt>-These stars form when a star runs out of hydrogen and begin to fuse helium. These stars will consume all the fuel in their cores in just a few million years.</dt><br>
        <li><b>White Dwarfs</b></li>
          <dt>-White Dwarfs are formed when the star has run out of hydrogen in its core and doesn't have enough mass to force the higher elements into fusion. White Dwarfs will eventually cooldown to the background temperature of the universe, but this process takes hundreds of billions of years.</dt><br>
        <li><b>Neutron Stars</b></li>
          <dt>-Neutron Stars are the cores of a massive star that has been compressed past the white dwarf stage during a supernova. Neutron stars are composed entirely of neutrons, and are supported by the repulsion of closely-packed neutrons.</dt><br>
        <li><b>Brown Dwarfs</b></li>
          <dt>-These stars are often refered to as failed stars as they lack the mass to ignite and fuse the hydrogen in their cores. These stars can be extremely small, often 13 to 80 Jupiter masses.</dt>
